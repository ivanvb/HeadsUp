# HeadsUp

This is my first Android application. A Clone of the [Heads Up game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wb.headsup&hl=es).



# What I Learned During This Project

* To read the Android official documentation.
* The Activity Lifecycle.
* Store data permanently on the user's phone.
* Use of various Android components such as Switch, Button, TextView, DialogFragment, CardView, among others.
* Use of I18N.
* Adapt my application for different Screen Sizes and Densities.
* Implementation of a Dark Mode.
